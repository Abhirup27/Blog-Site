## To Do

- [x] Connect to a SQL server and make data persistent.
- [x] Configure the dockerfile to work with mariadb server.
- [ ] View the blog entries date wise
- [ ] Arrange by most recent, oldest, relevant(search)
- [ ] Implement a search engine(queries the server using a different protocol).
- [ ] Add the option to make posts private.
- [ ] Enable adding images to the text.
- [ ] In the future, markdown support.
- [ ] Improve the UI. Describe what the app is about in the home page.
- [ ] Make a sidebar which shows recent public posts. It can use socket io to communicate in different protocol, to update in realtime(not by page refresh)
